# sagacious-and-adventure
my first project on GitHub

I have read a message about how to be a good programmer from Public number-Weixin ,then I sign up my  account number on
GitHub,I am afraid about my poor English ,but now I begin to start my firsr repository-sagacious and adventure which 
chinese means is " 睿智与勇敢"！with full confidence!

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
struct person
(
   char name[20];
   int age;
   char major[50];
   char edu_backgd[20];
) XiaTian;
int main()
{
		strcpy(XiaTian.name, "LuXistian");
		XiaTian.age=24;
		strcpy(XiaTian.major, "Pricision Instruments and Mechinery");
    strcpy(XiaTian.edu_backgd, "Master's Degree");
    printf("My name is %s at the age of %d,who major in %s with the educational background of %s",XiaTian.name
    ,XiaTian.age, XiaTian.major,XiaTian.edu_backgd);
    
    return 0;
}
